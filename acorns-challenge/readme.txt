Code challenge for acorns:

Instructions:
Use GitHub for your repository.  When complete, please send the link to the GitHub repo to oscar@acorns.com  You are welcome to ask questions.

Part 1:
Use Redfin to test the following scenarios using Ruby, Cucumber, and Capybara:
1. Signing in with valid username and password. Verify that you are signed in.
2. Searching for a property in a city with at least 3 filters. Verify that you get results back and that each result matches your criteria.
Note: You may use page objects if you want.

Part 2:
Use https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm to test the following scenarios using Ruby, RSpec, and Faraday:
1. Search for a particular property and verify the response status and that the response body contains the results that match your criteria. (NOTE: I just guessed that you didn't want me to automate the signup process here, because doing that frint end process in rspec would just be silly.)
